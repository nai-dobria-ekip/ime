Project Overview
This is a Java-based Student Management System program that allows the user to input, store, and display student details including their name, age, and grade. The system supports a fixed number of students (5 in this case) and displays all the student information once the data entry process is complete.

System Requirements
Before building and running the project, ensure that the following requirements are met:

Hardware Requirements:
A computer with at least 2GB of RAM (Recommended 4GB)
100MB of free disk space
Software Requirements:
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like:
IntelliJ IDEA
Eclipse
NetBeans
Or a simple text editor such as Visual Studio Code
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and build the Student Management System project:

Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
Download and install JDK from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK.
Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.
Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable, and add the bin directory to your PATH.
To verify your installation, open the terminal (Command Prompt or terminal on macOS/Linux) and type:

Копиране
java -version
This should display the installed version of Java.

Step 2: Create Project Directory
Create a new directory on your local machine for the project, e.g., StudentManagementSystem.

bash
Копиране
mkdir StudentManagementSystem
cd StudentManagementSystem
Step 3: Create Java Source File
Inside the project directory, create a new Java file named StudentManagementSystem.java and paste the code provided earlier into the file.

Копиране
nano StudentManagementSystem.java
(Alternatively, use your preferred text editor or IDE to create and edit the file.)

Step 4: Compile the Java Program
To compile the program, open your terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run the following command:

Копиране
javac StudentManagementSystem.java
This will compile the Java source code into bytecode, creating a StudentManagementSystem.class file.

Step 5: Run the Program
To run the compiled Java program, use the following command:

Копиране
java StudentManagementSystem
This will start the program and prompt you to enter student details. Follow the on-screen instructions to input student information and display it at the end.

Code Explanation
Student Class
The Student class holds the attributes for each student (name, age, and grade). It has the following key components:

Constructor: Initializes the student object with the provided name, age, and grade.
Method displayStudentDetails(): Outputs the student's details to the console.
StudentManagementSystem Class
This is the main class containing the program logic:

The program allows input for up to 5 students.
Uses a Scanner object to collect user input for each student's name, age, and grade.
After collecting the data, the program stores the information in an array of Student objects.
Finally, it displays the details of all entered students.
Expected Output
When the program runs, the user will be prompted to enter the details for up to 5 students. After the details are entered, the program will output the list of all students entered with their names, ages, and grades.

Example output:

yaml
Копиране
Enter the details of student 1
Enter name: Alice
Enter age: 20
Enter grade: 85.5
Would you like to enter details for another student? (yes/no)
yes
Enter the details of student 2
Enter name: Bob
Enter age: 22
Enter grade: 90.0
Would you like to enter details for another student? (yes/no)
no

Student Details:
Student Name: Alice
Age: 20
Grade: 85.5
-----------------------------
Student Name: Bob
Age: 22
Grade: 90.0
-----------------------------
Customization
You can modify this system to include:

More than 5 students: Adjust the size of the students array.
Additional student attributes such as address, email, or phone number.
Validation on user input (e.g., ensuring age is a positive number).
Advanced features such as searching for students by name or grade.
Troubleshooting
If you face issues running or compiling the program, here are some common solutions:

Error: javac not recognized: Ensure Java is installed and the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set correctly.
Error: Scanner input not working: Make sure the terminal or command prompt window is active when you're entering data.
Error: NoClassDefFoundError or ClassNotFoundException: Make sure you compiled the .java file successfully before running the program.
Conclusion
You have now built and run the Student Management System in Java! This simple project can serve as the foundation for more complex student management applications with additional features.
